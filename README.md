FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is an international program designed to engage children in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through hands-on learning and robotics. Established in 1998 as a partnership between FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and The LEGO Group, FLL aims to inspire young minds by presenting them with real-world challenges that they can solve using engineering principles.
